This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Gitalist.

0.000002 2009-12-06
   - Add documentation about how to configure a Gitalist instance.
   - Fix so that invalid repository directory will be detected at application
     startup and a helpful error message will be displayed.
   - Add --repos_dir command line parameter to all of the scripts which can
     be used to force the repository directory, overriding config and
     environment.
   - Add GITALIST_REPOS_DIR environment variable which will determine the
     repository path (overriding normal config) if set.
   - Change so that no default repos path is in the config when installed from
     CPAN (when checked out of git, behavior of browsing AppDir/../ is
     maintained).
   - Do not allow directory traversal via the p param.
