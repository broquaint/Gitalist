    - Major frontend redesign, thanks to ranguard and the web designers at
      Foxtons for making this happen.
    - Major URI overhaul, Gitalist has gone from old gitweb style CGI
      parameters to proper URIs, however the old URIs are still supported
      and will redirect appropriately (Tomas Doran).
    - With the URI overhaul also came breaking up actions into fragments
      for use with Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude.
    - BIG BREAKING CHANGE - Gitalist::Model::GitRepos has been renamed
      Gitalist::Model::CollectionOfRepos. You need to fix your config and

    - Project has been renamed Repository to correspond with normal git
      terminology.
    - Repos has been refactored into a CollectionOfRepositories role
      and two differnet concrete implementations (the Catalyst model
      chooses which type to build based on the config).
    - Remove all tabs and fix no tabs test (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)
    - Decode getpwuid values correctly (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)
    - Generate correct provides information in META.yml so that search.cpan
      indexes the classes contained in Gitalist correctly.

     be used to force the repository directory, overriding config and
     environment.
   - Add GITALIST_REPOS_DIR environment variable which will determine the
     repository path (overriding normal config) if set.
   - Change so that no default repos path is in the config when installed from
     CPAN (when checked out of git, behavior of browsing AppDir/../ is
     maintained).
   - Do not allow directory traversal via the p param.
