Gitalist - a transitional project to convert gitweb.cgi to a Catalyst app.

The idea behind this project is to move gitweb.cgi away from a single
monolithic CGI script and into a modern Catalyst app. Fortunately this is not
as daunting as it might seem at first as gitweb.cgi follows an MVC type
structure. Once gitweb.cgi has been suitably Catalysed then it can move from
being "this was once gitweb.cgi" to a project of its own (hence the
"transitional" in the description).

As it stands Gitalist is very much in its infancy and hasn't got far
beyond a layout template and a single controller.

USAGE

To get Gitalist up and running just set projectroot & repo_dir (one in
the same unfortunately at this point) in gitalist.conf to point to the
directory that contains your repositories. With that done just run:

  perl script/gitalist_server.pl
