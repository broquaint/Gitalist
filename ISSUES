* Root /search page doesn't do anything
* Atom feed sucks shit (see t/atom.t)
* OPML & RSS & Atom Feed dates incorrect format
* Gitweb compat URIs are borked - there were some I just wholesale ripped out. Put back..
* Sort out commitdiff so conflicted merges have an equivalent display to gitweb (d7f39bebabeb31ce9a7b4f1b6f3db9f391b78c3e as a reference)
* Need to sanitise the input ...
* The snapshot action does not properly support tgz - requests for this format will receive a tar.  tbz2 is not supported at all (yet).
